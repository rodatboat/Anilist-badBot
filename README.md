# Anilist-badBot
This bot follows a bunch of randos from the global activity tab (max of 50 at a time). It also lets you unfollow everyone.

Currently it is sort of slow, and very inefficient but it works. Might fix it later.

# Instructions
1. open config.json and input your session token and id
1. run main.py
2. choose your poison
3. profit ???

If you want to un-follow everyone without your actual friends then just add their name and id to the exceptions.json
